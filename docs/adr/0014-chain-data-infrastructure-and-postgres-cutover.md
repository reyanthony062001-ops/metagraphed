# ADR 0014 — Chain-data infrastructure: the real self-hosted core, D1's reliability crisis, and the Postgres serving cutover

- **Status:** Accepted — supersedes ADR 0010 (chain-direct block explorer), ADR
  0012 (chain-data ingestion), and ADR 0013 (hybrid deployment topology) in
  full, and supersedes ADR 0006 (provenance-tiered storage)'s D1/dynamic-data
  tier section specifically (0006's git-tier and R2-tier decisions are
  unaffected and remain in force).
- **Date:** 2026-07-10
- **Why superseded, not amended:** 0013 accumulated four inline "Amendment"
  blocks over two weeks (Railway retirement, a Rust rewrite, a node-tier
  reversal, a poller/streamer relocation) and each amendment was itself stale
  or contradicted within days by the next real event. Patching a live
  document faster than reality changes stopped working; this ADR is a single,
  freshly-verified snapshot instead, written the way ADRs are supposed to
  work — a new record replaces an outdated one rather than growing another
  correction on top of it. If reality moves again, write ADR 0015; don't
  reopen this one.
- **Relates to:** #4746 (D1 write-path reliability, the incident that
  triggered this rewrite), #4686 (Postgres-tier subrequest cancellation),
  #4695 (extrinsics parity harness), #4669 (call_args shape reconciliation
  roadmap), #4698 (a D1 coverage gap traced to this same mechanism), the
  private `metagraphed-indexer-rs` repo, and JSO-2054/#2518 (archive-node
  hardware decision).

## Context — verified directly against running infrastructure, not inherited from prior docs

**The indexer box (`meta-indexer-01-us-lax1`) is the real, permanent core —
not a Railway stopgap.** It runs, self-hosted, with no Railway involvement:
`indexer-rs` (Rust, live-follows the finalized chain head), `indexer-rs-backfill`
(sharded historical decode), `metagraphed-indexer-postgres-1` (TimescaleDB,
the durable chain sink both indexers write to), `metagraphed-indexer-redis-1`
(cursor state), `metagraphed-registry-postgres-1` (a _separate_ Postgres
instance for registry data — different scale, different write cadence, kept
independent so one can't take the other down), and `metagraphed-streamer`
(described below). Railway's only remaining role anywhere in this system is
`wss-lb`. ADR 0013's "Railway core, Hetzner escape hatch" framing described a
plan that was overtaken by events — the team went straight to bare metal.

**A separate, full archive node (`meta-archive-01-us-nyc1`) is live but not
yet caught up.** `node-subtensor --sync=full --state-pruning=archive
--blocks-pruning=archive`, syncing from genesis. As of this writing it is
**~51% synced** to chain tip (measured via `system_syncState`), restarting
roughly every 12 hours (a stability wrinkle, not fatal), and is expected to
reach chain tip in **another 1–2 weeks**. Until it does, `indexer-rs-backfill`'s
historical decode runs against a **temporary** public OnFinality WS endpoint —
this is explicitly a stopgap, not a design choice, and nothing should be
built assuming it's permanent. Deep historical re-backfill work (below) is
gated on this node reaching steady state; live-forward ingestion is not.

**D1 was fed by a second, independent live-following pipeline — the realtime
streamer — which turned out to be a confirmed reliability problem, and has
since been stopped rather than fixed.** `scripts/stream-events.py` (a Python
process, container `metagraphed-streamer` on the same indexer box) subscribed
to finalized heads and pushed decoded rows to the edge Worker's
`/api/v1/internal/blocks` and `/internal/events`, which write to D1's
`blocks`/`extrinsics`/`account_events` tables — a genuinely _different_
codebase and a _different_ live indexer from `indexer-rs`, two independent
processes following the same chain tip into two different databases. The
GitHub Actions backstop poller that used to catch gaps in this specific
pipeline (`refresh-events.yml`) was deleted 2026-07-04 on the premise that the
self-hosted streamer alone would be reliable enough. **That premise was
disproven:** #4746 found the streamer sustaining 154 `ingest_write_failed`
errors and 15 WebSocket reconnects in a 3-hour window, continuously, with
zero container restarts — not a crash, a live degradation — traced to a
plausible mechanism where a blocking retry loop on a failed D1 write starves
the same connection servicing the chain-head subscription, and a subscription
reconnect silently, permanently skips whatever finalized during the gap
(finalized-head subscriptions don't backfill missed notifications). This
produced measured recent-block coverage as low as 38–61% missing in several
1000-block windows near the chain tip, against 0% missing in an older window.
**Resolved 2026-07-10, same day, by stopping the streamer entirely**
(`docker stop metagraphed-streamer`, `unless-stopped` policy so it stays
stopped) rather than hardening it: once D1 stopped being the primary serving
tier (see below), keeping a second live indexer running just to keep a
now-secondary fallback fresh no longer made sense — one first-party live
indexer is enough. See `docs/realtime-streamer.md`.

**D1 has now hit its ~10GB hard capacity ceiling in production once, and was
independently found teetering on it again today.** `account_events` grew
unbounded (365-day retention that never actually got old enough to prune,
because the table was younger than that) until it triggered `D1_ERROR:
Exceeded maximum DB size` — a full write outage — on 2026-07-04, fixed with
an emergency cut to 3-day retention. `blocks` and `extrinsics` were never
given the same fix and were found today in the _identical_ state: their
oldest row was only ~16 days old (retention had never once engaged for
either), the shared database was at 9.0GB of its 10GB cap, and extrinsics at
~101k rows/day would be ~45GB at a true 365-day steady state — more than 4x
the entire cap on its own. **Fixed 2026-07-10** (`BLOCK_RETENTION_MS` → 30
days, `EXTRINSIC_RETENTION_MS` → 5 days) — this is an emergency-driven number
matching `account_events`' own precedent, not a product decision, and is
explicitly meant to be raised only once Postgres serving is trusted.

**Hyperdrive + a dedicated `data-api` Worker already exist and already CAN
serve blocks/extrinsics/account_events from Postgres — the one live attempt
to rely on this was reverted the same day.** `METAGRAPH_BLOCKS_SOURCE` was
flipped to `"postgres"` on 2026-07-09 on the strength of a spot check that
turned out unfalsifiable (`tryPostgresTier` silently swallows every failure
and falls back to D1, so comparing API output against direct Postgres can't
tell a genuine hit from a masked fallback). Live re-testing found the
`DATA_API` service-binding subrequest reporting `outcome: "canceled"` on a
real, reproducible fraction of requests (#4686), so the flag was reverted
same day. **Root-caused 2026-07-10** against Cloudflare's own Hyperdrive
documentation: neither `data-api.mjs` nor `registry-sync-api.mjs` wrapped
their per-request queries in a transaction, so a standalone `SET
statement_timeout` had no guarantee of landing on the same physical
connection as the query that followed it (Hyperdrive resets session state
between pooled connections); both also called `sql.end()` on every request,
which Cloudflare's docs explicitly say is unsupported, unnecessary extra
work. Both are fixed (each request's queries now run inside `sql.begin()`;
the manual teardown is removed).

**Extrinsics carries an additional, separate blocker beyond the connection
bugs above.** `indexer-rs`'s decoded `call_args` diverged from D1's decode
shape across roughly 45 of 105 sampled call types (SS58/hex encoding,
`Option<T>` unwrapping, nested `RuntimeCall` reconstruction, Ethereum
U256/H160 shapes, and more). The root bug in `indexer-rs` was fixed
2026-07-10, but only for blocks decoded from ~8589233 onward — every row
written before that fix still has the old, wrong shape, and needs a full
re-decode once the archive node is available for it. This is independent of
the connection-affinity fix above.

**All three cutover flags flipped to `"postgres"` 2026-07-10**
(`wrangler.jsonc`: `METAGRAPH_BLOCKS_SOURCE`, `METAGRAPH_EXTRINSICS_SOURCE`,
`METAGRAPH_ACCOUNT_EVENTS_SOURCE`), same day as the connection-affinity fix.
Given no real production traffic yet, the remaining known gaps (the #4687
9,000-block Postgres hole for blocks; the pre-fix mixed `call_args` shape for
extrinsics) were accepted rather than re-verified against a fully clean
sustained window first — a deliberate, explicit trade-off for the current
pre-launch state, not a quiet abandonment of the stricter criteria this ADR
sets out below for a real launch. `tryPostgresTier` still falls back to D1 on
any failure, so this remains reversible with a single-flag revert.

## Decision

1. **The self-hosted indexer box is the permanent core.** Not a Railway
   interim step — treat Postgres/Timescale + `indexer-rs` + Redis on
   dedicated hardware as the durable, long-term chain-data sink. Railway's
   only remaining role in this system is `wss-lb`; don't plan around
   reintroducing it.
2. **D1 is a temporary, deliberately reliability-constrained hot cache for
   live (last few days) data only** — fed by the realtime streamer — kept
   alive _only_ until each tier's Postgres serving is proven reliable, not an
   architectural end state. Its per-tier retention (30d blocks / 5d
   extrinsics / 3d account_events as of this ADR) is an emergency-calibrated
   number tied to measured ingestion volume and the shared 10GB cap, not a
   product decision — don't raise any of them without re-measuring current
   volume against remaining headroom first.
3. **A tier's cutover flag flips to `"postgres"` only when all of the
   following hold**, learning directly from the first attempt's failure:
   - The specific bugs already found for that serving path are fixed and
     merged (for blocks/extrinsics/account_events: the Hyperdrive
     connection-affinity fix, #4686).
   - Live re-verification uses a block/extrinsic/event confirmed to exist
     **only** in Postgres, not one present in both stores — a both-stores
     row cannot distinguish genuine Postgres serving from a silently masked
     D1 fallback, which is exactly how the first "verified" flip turned out
     to be unfalsifiable.
   - `tryPostgresTier`'s per-branch failure logging (already shipped) shows
     zero unexplained fallbacks over a sustained live window — not a single
     spot check.
   - For extrinsics specifically: the call-args parity harness (#4695)
     confirms shape-identical output across a representative sample of call
     types, not just the ones already spot-checked.
4. **Deep historical correctness is a separate, slower effort — do not
   conflate it with live-serving readiness.** Re-decoding pre-fix
   blocks/extrinsics and backfilling gaps from before `indexer-rs` went live
   both require the self-hosted archive node at or near chain tip (operator
   estimate: 1–2 weeks from this ADR's date). Cutting a tier's _live_ serving
   over to Postgres does not require this — "recent data is trustworthy" and
   "all of history is" are different claims with different gates.
5. **The realtime streamer's reliability is now a first-class, tracked
   concern, not an assumed property.** Its push-retry loop currently blocks
   the same execution path that services its chain-head subscription — fix
   this (tracked in #4746) independent of the Postgres cutover, since D1
   remains load-bearing for however long the cutover takes.
6. **Once a tier's Postgres serving is proven and its D1 role is fully
   retired, delete that tier's D1 table and prune logic** rather than
   leaving it running as inert legacy weight.

## Consequences

**Gains (once the sequencing below completes):** real, uncapped deep
history; D1's capacity ceiling stops being an operational hazard because
nothing durable depends on it; one first-party, self-hosted source of truth
per data class instead of two independent live-following pipelines that can
silently drift from each other.

**Costs / risks — tracked, not hand-waved:**

- **Two live pipelines exist simultaneously during the transition** (the
  streamer → D1, `indexer-rs` → Postgres) and can disagree; this is exactly
  what surfaced the extrinsics shape divergence and the account*events D1
  gap (#4698) as \_findings*, not silent corruption — a property worth
  keeping until the cutover is trusted, not a bug to rush away.
- **D1 remains a genuine, load-bearing production dependency** — not
  actually a "hot cache" in truth — until every tier's cutover completes.
  Treat its reliability (retention, the streamer's write path) as an active
  concern, not a deprecated corner.
- **The archive-node timeline is a real, external constraint** (1–2 weeks as
  of this ADR). Deep-history work should wait for it rather than substitute
  a lower-quality source under time pressure — the temporary OnFinality
  backfill source exists precisely to avoid that trade.
- **A cutover verified against Postgres-only data can still regress** if the
  underlying bug class (silent-fallback masking a failure) isn't watched for
  in future changes to `tryPostgresTier` or the `data-api`/`registry-sync-api`
  Workers — the logging added in #4686's follow-up is the guardrail; don't
  remove it as "noise."

## Sequencing

1. ✅ **Foundation.** Self-hosted Postgres/Timescale + `indexer-rs` + Redis on
   the indexer box, replacing the original Railway plan. Done.
2. ✅ **D1 capacity emergency fixed.** `blocks`/`extrinsics` retention
   corrected to match `account_events`' precedent (merged 2026-07-10).
3. ✅ **Hyperdrive connection-affinity fixed.** `data-api.mjs` and
   `registry-sync-api.mjs` now run each request's queries inside a
   transaction and no longer call `sql.end()` (merged 2026-07-10),
   addressing #4686's two documented root-cause candidates.
4. ✅ **All three flags flipped to `"postgres"`, same day.** With no real
   production traffic yet, the accepted-gap trade-off in Decision point 3 was
   deliberately relaxed for blocks and extrinsics (the known #4687 9,000-block
   hole, and the pre-2026-07-10 mixed extrinsics call_args shape,
   respectively) rather than waiting for a fully clean sustained-window
   re-verification — a call made explicitly because of the current
   no-users/pre-launch state, not a retraction of the stricter criteria this
   ADR sets for a real launch. Revisit before one.
5. ✅ **Realtime streamer stopped**, not fixed. Once serving no longer
   depended on D1 being fresh, the better fix for "two independent live
   indexers writing to two databases" was removing the redundant one, not
   hardening its push-retry/subscription coupling (#4746's remaining half is
   now moot — there's no live D1 writer left to have that bug). D1's data is
   frozen at whatever it held when the streamer stopped and will shrink to
   nothing on its own via the existing prune cron (30d/5d/3d windows) — no
   further action needed to wind it down.
6. ✅ **account_events flipped alongside the other two** (#4696's route,
   no shape-parity risk regardless).
7. 🔲 **Full historical re-backfill (archive-gated, ~1–2 week external
   timeline).** Re-decode pre-fix blocks/extrinsics in Postgres and backfill
   the #4687 gap once the archive node reaches chain tip; do not attempt this
   against the temporary OnFinality source — that source exists for exactly
   this reason. This is the one item that actually needs the archive.
8. 🔲 **Delete D1's tables and prune logic once they're empty.** The streamer
   stopping means this is now just a matter of time (item 5), not a blocking
   migration — revisit once D1's row counts hit zero and remove the dead
   code/schema rather than leaving it as inert legacy weight indefinitely.
9. 🔲 **The extrinsics parity harness (#4695)** remains valuable to actually
   quantify what step 4's accepted gap covers, now that it's no longer a
   precondition for the flip — do this to inform step 7's backfill scope,
   not to re-gate a decision already made.
10. ✅ **neurons/neuron_daily write path built + flipped (#4771).** Unlike
    blocks/extrinsics/account_events, this tier had NO Postgres equivalent at
    all before #4771 — `workers/data-api.mjs` gained one write route
    (`POST /api/v1/internal/neurons-sync`, `handleNeuronsSync`) that upserts
    both tables from the same daily `refresh-metagraph.yml` fetch, alongside
    (not replacing) the existing R2-stage-to-D1 path. Deliberately NOT a
    fifth dedicated Worker: it targets the IDENTICAL Postgres instance
    `data-api.mjs` already reads from, unlike `registry-sync-api.mjs`'s split
    (a genuinely separate database, isolated on purpose) — splitting read and
    write for the same database would have added a whole Worker/config/
    binding/secret for zero bundle-budget benefit.
    A real live-cron run hit a genuine bug the first time (a bound JS array
    serializing incorrectly under this Worker's `fetch_types: false`
    Hyperdrive setting — fixed by binding scalars via `sql.unsafe` instead;
    caught via `wrangler tail` against a real production payload, not a
    guess). Once fixed, `METAGRAPH_NEURONS_SOURCE` flipped to `"postgres"`
    the same day: the daily cron synced 30,323 rows into a Postgres that
    started completely empty, and a sampled row (netuid=8, uid=0) matched D1
    field-for-field, including full-precision decimals and the 0/1-to-boolean
    mapping. Stronger than the other three tiers' first (reverted) attempt,
    which compared a row present in BOTH stores and couldn't distinguish
    genuine Postgres serving from a silently masked D1 fallback (#4686) —
    here Postgres had no prior data at all, so a correct row is unambiguous.
